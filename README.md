# Julian-Nash-flask-lessons
after reading the book and two courses on the flask framework, this is a very cool finger warm-up and a
cool course for those who used to write all their flask code in one app.py file) here is a link to it 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUmUV8YOzgM&amp;amp;list=PLF2JzgCW6-YY_TZCmBrbOpgx5pSNBD0_L

before downloading or viewing this code, you need to understand that this is just code from the course I
mentioned earlier and that the code is commented there does not mean that I comment the code in my normal
projects (because it is a bad habit) later I will add a manual (that to make the code work) and I will add 
navigation for easier use since I didn't want to rewrite the code for each lesson)

as said there is a lot of commented code in the files, if something doesn't bother you the easiest way to 
figure out what's wrong is to watch a video on the topic, that's why I didn't sign every function... 
and there's no complicated code or anything like that. and since the course is already 3 years old, some 
points had to be changed or simply left at the functional level, anyway, this is the work of the frontend, and I would not really like to write there now
